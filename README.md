# Spotify React App

This is a React application to find Albums and Musics from Spotify API and listen a 30 seconds preview. :fire:

## Getting Started :punch:

To use the app, you must first clone this repository and open it on your computer.

Open the **server.js** file at the root folder and add your own **SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID** and **SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET**.

### Installing and running the app :100:

To run the app, you need to install the dependencies of the root folder and the dependencies of the client folder. So let's do it.

Open the terminal at the root folder and run the following command:

```
npm install / yarn
```

then access the client folder

```
cd client
```

and again, run

```
npm install / yarn
```

and that's it. You now can go back to root folder and start the app using

```
cd ..
```

```
npm start / yarn start
```

Your application will run on http://localhost:3000 and the server on http://localhost:4000

### Using the app

Login to your spotify account and use the searchbar to find your favorite band albums. :satisfied: :guitar:
